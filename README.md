Creating a Character:
- Once a character is created, a name.txt file will be created with a default set of stats, an empty inventory, and 0 gold. Through fighting monsters, you will be able to earn XP to level up your character and increase their stats, obtain powerful weapons, and acquire rare drops.

CharManager:
- To navigate objects (NPC, Area, Character, Monster, Item), CharManager is a way to map all objects to a String name, making them easily accessible.
